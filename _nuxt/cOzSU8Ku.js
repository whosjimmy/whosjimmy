Tasked with helping to reconstruct the final moments of an American president's life, Jimmy found himself saddened by memories of the event itself but at the same time jubilant to be working on such an important project. Working under Gord Smith from the effects design firm of FXSMITH, Jimmy designed and built an air-powered, electric triggered mechanism to simulate a gunshot to the head. It was fitted into a soft rubber appliance worn on the head of Steve Reed, the actor portraying John Kennedy in the film. The appliance was used in the assassination scene in Dealey Plaza. It consisted of relays, timers, compressed air and stage blood. It was fabricated in Toronto and shipped to Dallas, where it would be installed daily on Steve Reed’s head and fired fourteen times over the next two weeks.")]),e("p",null,"Jimmy's interest in mechanics began at a very young age as a fascination with anything that moved or flashed; by age four, he had already disassembled all of his toys to see how they worked. He loved nothing more than trips to his great grandmother's house where he was afforded the freedom to explore the basement, finding wires and old appliances – a veritable treasure trove for a young boy with a burgeoning passion for anything mechanical. Jimmy chose to spend most of his time on his own, or with friends sharing similar interests, tinkering around with machines, pouring over the book series Mechanix Illustrated and building the projects within its pages."),e("p",null,"In the third grade, at the age of 8, Jimmy built his first go-kart – a simple construction without a motor, a nearby hill provided its only propulsion. Jimmy's kart may not have been the fastest, but while the other boys' karts were built by their fathers, Jimmy had constructed his entirely on his own. The son of an insurance man who was respected in his field but not mechanically inclined, everything Jimmy learned was self-taught. At age 11, when his family moved into a larger home with a 2-car garage, Jimmy used the extra space to build a bigger and more elaborate motorized go-kart. This garage, or “Jimmy’s Shop” as it became known, served as the backdrop for many projects between 1966 and 1986, including go-karts, motorized bicycles, mini-bikes, dirt bikes, motorcycles, nitrous oxide kits and cars, not to mention countless other non-vehicular projects."),e("p",null,"When Jimmy was in the ninth grade, he began to study machine shop and drafting in school.

Just three days after his sixteenth birthday, Jimmy got his driver's license, and a whole new world opened up before him – a world filled with the promise of freedom only a motorcycle could deliver.

In addition to getting two machines CSA approved, he was responsible for managing monthly maintenance of machines, assembling machines for sale, and managing all electrical for machines. Here, his troubleshooting skills were refined as a result of field repairs on high speed mail processing machines.
