        <p>James Gawley, or &ldquo;Jimmy Claws&rdquo; as he is known to friends and family, earned this nickname through an<br />extensive career in the film industry, including work on such films as <i>I Robot</i>, the X-Men series, and<br /><i>Pacific Rim</i>.</p>
        <p>One of Jimmy&rsquo;s first experiences working as a special makeup effects artist was on the 1991 Oliver Stone<br />film, <i>JFK</i>. Tasked with helping to reconstruct the final moments of an American president's life, Jimmy<br />found himself saddened by memories of the event itself but at the same time jubilant to be working on<br />such an important project. Working under Gord Smith from the effects design firm of FXSMITH, Jimmy<br />designed and built an air-powered, electric triggered mechanism to simulate a gunshot to the head. It<br />was fitted into a soft rubber appliance worn on the head of Steve Reed, the actor portraying John<br />Kennedy in the film. The appliance was used in the assassination scene in Dealey Plaza. It consisted of<br />relays, timers, compressed air and stage blood. It was fabricated in Toronto and shipped to Dallas, where<br />it would be installed daily on Steve Reed&rsquo;s head and fired fourteen times over the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>Jimmy's interest in mechanics began at a very young age as a fascination with anything that moved or<br />flashed; by age four, he had already disassembled all of his toys to see how they worked. He loved<br />nothing more than trips to his great grandmother's house where he was afforded the freedom to explore<br />the basement, finding wires and old appliances &ndash; a veritable treasure trove for a young boy with a<br />burgeoning passion for anything mechanical. Jimmy chose to spend most of his time on his own, or with<br />friends sharing similar interests, tinkering around with machines, pouring over the book series Mechanix<br />Illustrated and building the projects within its pages.</p>
        <p>In the third grade, at the age of 8, Jimmy built his first go-kart &ndash; a simple construction without a motor, a<br />nearby hill provided its only propulsion. Jimmy's kart may not have been the fastest, but while the other<br />boys' karts were built by their fathers, Jimmy had constructed his entirely on his own. The son of an<br />insurance man who was respected in his field but not mechanically inclined, everything Jimmy learned<br />was self-taught. At age 11, when his family moved into a larger home with a 2-car garage, Jimmy used<br />the extra space to build a bigger and more elaborate motorized go-kart. This garage, or &ldquo;Jimmy&rsquo;s Shop&rdquo;<br />as it became known, served as the backdrop for many projects between 1966 and 1986, including<br />go-karts, motorized bicycles, mini-bikes, dirt bikes, motorcycles, nitrous oxide kits and cars, not to<br />mention countless other non-vehicular projects.</p>
        <p>When Jimmy was in the ninth grade, he began to study machine shop and drafting in school. By the end<br />of the school year, he was able to read drawings and operate any machine in the shop. Jimmy continued<br />to take shop classes until graduation, supplementing his studies with a part time job manufacturing<br />packaging machinery. Just three days after his sixteenth birthday, Jimmy got his driver's license, and a<br />whole new world opened up before him &ndash; a world filled with the promise of freedom only a motorcycle<br />could deliver. He soon got his wish: a '62 Honda 250 road bike&hellip; in pieces. But in no time at all, Jimmy<br />had it running and on the road.</p>
        <p>Upon graduating from high school in 1974, Jimmy attained a job working in a prototype shop making<br />precision parts to test new products. This is where he refined his machining skills and learned about<br />plastics and moulding &ndash; skills that would prove extremely useful in his future career in the film industry.<br />One such example being his work on the first of three X-Men movies in 1999, during which Jimmy<br />oversaw the design and moulding of over 2000 Wolverine claws produced in his shop for the film.</p>
        <p>Jimmy's machining career took him to Owen Tri-cut, a small Mississauga, Ontario manufacturing<br />company where he worked on letter opening machines. In addition to getting two machines CSA<br />approved, he was responsible for managing monthly maintenance of machines, assembling machines for<br />sale, and managing all electrical for machines. Here, his troubleshooting skills were refined as a result of<br />field repairs on high speed mail processing machines. Jimmy also worked with Oshawa Pattern &amp; Model,<br />a family-owned pattern company, making automotive verification fixtures. This experience allowed him<br />to further expand his knowledge base to include manufacturing tolerances and metal casting.</p>
        <p>Jimmy's movie career has included work on more than three dozen films including, in addition to the<br />aforementioned films, <i>Jacob's Ladder</i> (1990), <i>The Incredible Hulk</i> (2008), <i>RED</i> (2010), <i>Tomorrowland</i><br />(2015), and <i>Suicide Squad</i> (2016). He has greatly enjoyed the challenges these projects provide, giving<br />him the opportunity to apply his machining knowledge in new and creative ways to fit the specific needs<br />of the film industry. Having recently completed 6 months on Guillermo Del Toro&rsquo;s <i>Frankenstein</i>, Jimmy is<br />going into semi-retirement, pursuing a desire to share his unique experiences and knowledge acquired<br />from 35 years on film sets, working in special effects, makeup effects, and props.</p>
        <p>First, Jimmy will be presenting a series of free, progressive lessons on basic electricity, using safe, low<br />voltage devices and batteries to demonstrate foundation principles of electrical behavior, progressing<br />into more complicated circuits. These teachings will be of interest to builders incorporating animatronics<br />into creature builds with lighting or motion. The lessons will also be of interest to &ldquo;off grid&rdquo; enthusiasts<br />wanting to improve their homesite performance and efficiency by understanding low voltage<br />management and use. Further, this knowledge could be helpful to anyone building or repairing cars,<br />motorcycles, boats, or anything that works on batteries.</p>
        <p>Beyond Electricity: There will be a series of &ldquo;membership access&rdquo; lessons about &ldquo;how to&rdquo; construct<br />animatronic mechanisms for building creatures using pneumatics, servos, and hand/cable controls for<br />manual puppets including eye mechanisms.</p>
        <p><i>&ldquo;I want to encourage my fellow craftpersons to share their lifelong experiences in technology with those<br />who will follow&hellip; Remember how you learned it!"<br />Sincerely,<br />James Gawley</i></p>
